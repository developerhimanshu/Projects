I have developed an interactive maths quiz game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
=> I used CSS gradient to provide better look.
=> I used box shadow to give the 3d look to the game.
=> I used transitions for a nice interactivity and a good user experience.
=> I used different methods of JavaScript DOM.
=> I used JavaScript to change the inner HTML also show and hide the different elements.
=> I used some timing events functions like set interval and set timeout functions.
